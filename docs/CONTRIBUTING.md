# Contributing
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/tcunit/TcUnit/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/https://github.com/benhar-dev/vision-toolkit/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Make sure to edit the project with the same version of Visual Studio as the master branch. 
* Make sure to edit the project with the same build of TwinCAT XAE as the master branch. 
* Make sure to set your TwinCAT development environment to use Separate LineIDs. This is available in the TwinCAT XAE under **Tools→Options→TwinCAT→PLC Environment→Write options→Separate LineIDs** (set this to TRUE, more information is available [here](https://infosys.beckhoff.com/english.php?content=../content/1033/tc3_userinterface/18014403202147467.html&id=))
